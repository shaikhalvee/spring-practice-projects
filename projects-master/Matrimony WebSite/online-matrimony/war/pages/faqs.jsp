					<b>I cannot publish my profile or access other profiles.</b> <br>
					You can create/edit your profile before making payment to us. 
					But in order for you to publish your profile or access other profiles, you must make the payment.
					Please make sure you have made the payment to correct account as mentioned in 
					<a href="/Menu.do?action=view&hm=membership" class="link">Payment Options</a>.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>I have made the payment to correct account but still I cannot publish my profile.</b> <br>
					After we receive your payment, we will review your profile to see if all the guidelines are followed.
					If found satisfactory, we will enable the Publish option.
					This may take from 2 to 5 days after we receive your payment.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>
						Does my 12 months membership start on the date I register on the site 
						or on the date when I make the payment?
					</b> <br>
					After your payment is credited to our account, we will review your profile and if found
					as per the guidelines then we will enable Publish option on your profile. 
					Your membership start date will be the date on which Publish option is enabled on your profile.
					Tentatively, the start date of your membership will be after 3-5 working days 
					from the date we receive your payment in our account. <br>
					
					It is important to note that the date when you make payment may be different 
					from the date the payment gets credited to our account.
					This delay is different for various Payment Options. <br> 
					E.g. If you choose to send us Check / Demand Draft / Money Order, 
					then your membership start date is the 3-5 working days after your Check / Demand Draft / Money Order, 
					is credited to our account. <br>
					If you choose, NEFT / Net Banking transfer then it usually happens on the next working day.
					In this case, membership start date is 3-5 working days after Bank transfer.

				<li>
					<b>Can I create multiple profiles?</b> <br>
					No, to keep our web site authentic, we do not allow creation of multiple profiles.
